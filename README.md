# Pokemow show

This project was done as part of my practice of JavaScript + React, HTML & CSS. I used pure React, HTML5, CSS3 (you'll see a bit of flex), Git and VSCode.

This App consumes and [The Poke Api](https://pokeapi.co/) and allows you to find pokemos. In there you will be able to find a search bar in which you can type the name of a pokemon and will appear bellow. This pokemon will have a link for you to see more information or details about it.

You can also go and check the [The Components](https://github.com/ivanbatistao/pokemon-show/tree/main/src/components) and [CSS document](https://github.com/ivanbatistao/pokemon-show/blob/main/src/App.css).

Thanks for taking the time to check this project.

All feedback is welcome!
